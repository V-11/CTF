Let's use the [imageinfo](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#imageinfo) command to get the suggested profile which we will pass as the parameter to `--profile` when using other plugins.

Let's check the active processes when this memory dump was taken.. to do so, I will use the [pslist](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#pslist) plugin.

After spending some time analysing this process, it led to nothing.

In the description the author said ***he deleted a very important file*** so let's use the [filescan](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#filescan) plugin to search for common files extensions.

Interesting! I tried to dump it using the [dumpfiles](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#dumpfiles) plugin as usual but it resulted an error.  
After some googling I learnt from this [article](https://steemit.com/security/@nybble/forensic-extraire-des-fichiers-depuis-la-table-mft-avec-volatility-part-1-en) how to extract [MFT entries](https://whereismydata.wordpress.com/2009/06/05/forensics-what-is-the-mft/) using the [mftparser](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#mftparser) plugin.  
I opened the dumped file and searched for Important.txt
