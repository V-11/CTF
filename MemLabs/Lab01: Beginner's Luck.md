> My sister's computer crashed. We were very fortunate to recover this memory dump. Your job is get all her important files from the system.  
> From what we remember, we suddenly saw a black window pop up with something being executed.  
> When the crash happened, she was trying to draw something. Thats all we remember from the time of crash.

The description gave me couple clues:  
- The black window with something being excuted is CMD.  
- The application she was drawing with is mostly MS Paint.

Let's use the [imageinfo](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#imageinfo) command to get the suggested profile which we will pass as the parameter to `--profile` when using other plugins.

Good, let's check the active processes when this memory dump was taken.. to do so, I will use the [pslist](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#pslist) plugin.

Interesting! let's check what was excuted on CMD.. to do so, I will use the [consoles](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#consoles) plugin.

Base64 encoded string, decode however you like, It's our flag!

--------------------------------------------
We need to dump the process memory content then to see what she was doing on MS Paint.. to do so, I will use the [memdump](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#memdump) plugin.

We need to change its extension to `.data` in order to open it with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).  
After opening it.. I didn't know what to do, so I played with the values till I managed to notice some readable words.

We need to flip it.. to do so, `Right Click > Image > Transform > Flip Vertically`

--------------------------------------------

Now let's check the WinRAR process, It might have the last flag.  
I did that using [cmdline](https://volatilityfoundation.github.io/volatility/db/d6a/classvolatility_1_1plugins_1_1cmdline_1_1_cmdline.html) plugin to check the command-line arguments.

Apperantly, we got an ***important*** file :D  
Let's use the [filescan](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#filescan) plugin to check if there're any other important files in the `Documents` directory.

![](images/Lab1_08.png)

Nothing seems more ***important*** than the file we already saw, we need to dump it to check its content, I will use the [dumpfiles](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#dumpfiles) plugin and pass the physical address as a parameter to `-Q`

![](images/Lab1_09.png)

I tried to extract its content, but it was password-protected.  
I decided to check the readable strings to check if the password is hidden somewhere.

![](images/Lab1_10.png)

Okay, we need to dump the password hashes.. to do so, I will use the [hashdump](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#hashdump) plugin.

![](images/Lab1_11.png)

Don't forget to convert the hash characters to uppercase then use it as the password without cracking it, after doing so, you will find the last flag.
